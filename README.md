# vivado-risc-v

# Xilinx Vivado block designs for FPGA RISC-V SoC running Debian Linux distro.

This repository contains FPGA prototype of fully functional [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) Linux server
with networking, online Linux package repository and daily package updates.
It includes scripts and sources to generate RISC-V SoC HDL, Xilinx Vivado project, FPGA bitstream, and bootable SD card.
The SD card contains [RISC-V Open Source Supervisor Binary Interface (OpenSBI)](https://github.com/riscv/opensbi), [U-Boot](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot), [Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/) and [Debian root FS](https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V).
Linux package repositories and regular updates are provided by [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V).
Over 90% of packages of the whole Debian collection are available for download.

Also can be used to run [bare-metal](https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v/tree/master/bare-metal) or RTOS software.

The project is used as a reference design to validate RISC-V support in [Eclipse TCF](https://wiki.eclipse.org/TCF/RISC-V).

Latest Xilinx tools (Ver. 2020.1+) support debugging of RISC-V software over JTAG.

# Prerequisites

## Hardware
[Xilinx VC707](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-v7-vc707-g.html) or
[Xilinx KC705](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-k7-kc705-g.html) or
[Digilent Genesys 2](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/genesys-2/start) or
[Digilent Nexys Video](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-video/start) or
[Digilent Nexys A7 100T](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/start) or
[Digilent Arty A7 100T](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start) board.

VC707 allows to prototype more powerful system: up to 8 64-bit RISC-V cores, up to 100MHz clock speed, 1GB RAM.

KC705 and Genesys 2 are as fast as VC707, but have slightly smaller FPGA - up to 4 cores.

Nexys Video is several times less expensive, academic discount is avaialble. It supports up to 2 cores, up to 50MHz clock speed.

Nexys A7 100T and Arty A7 100T are least expensive supported boards. They have small FPGA, barely enough to run Linux on a single core RISC-V at 50MHz.

## Workstation
[Ubuntu 20 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) machine with min 32GB RAM is recommended.
sudo access required.

Alternatively, a Windows 10 machine with Ubuntu on Windows can be used to run the tools, see [Running RISC-V tools on Windows](docs/ubuntu-on-windows.md).

## Software
Download and install AMD Xilinx
[Vitis](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis.html).
Supported Vitis versions are 2020.1, 2020.2, 2021.1, 2021.2, 2022.1, 2022.2, 2023.1.
Vitis installation includes Vivado Design Suite - there is no need to install Vivado separately.

Nexys Video, Nexys A7 100T and Arty A7 100T are supported by free version of Vivado. KC705, VC707 and Genesys 2 require Vivado license.

If using a Digilent board, install [Vivado Board Files for Digilent FPGA Boards](https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards).

## Prepare the SD card
Use USB SD card reader to connect SD card to the workstation, and run:
```
./mk-sd-card
```
The script looks for USB memory device and asks confirmation before using it.
Make sure to confirm right SD card device - all old data will be erased.

## Booting Linux with QEMU
In come cases when Linux runs slow on the FPGA (especially designs with lower clock speeds or no ethernet access), it might be worth it to first install the dependencies quickly before running it on FPGA.

You can run the following:
```
./qemu/boot_qemu.sh
```

The script will check for the existance of a debian image under `debian-riscv64/` and run `./mk-sd-image` as needed. Then it will clone and make a suitable version of u-boot and opensbi for QEMU before finally booting Linux.

Once Linux has booted successfully on QEMU, you can also easily ssh and scp too:
```
ssh -p2222 debian@localhost
```

Once all this is done, you can make the sd card without making the image:
```
./mk-sd-card skip_mk_img
```

## Program the FPGA flash memory
```
source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.2/settings64.sh
make CONFIG=rocket64b2 BOARD=nexys-video flash
```
Alternatively, [flash memory can be programmed using Vivado GUI](docs/vivado-flash.md).

## Linux login

Host name: debian

User login and password: debian debian

Root login and password: root root

You can login over UART console:
```
sudo miniterm /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```
or, after Linux boot, over SSH:
```
ssh debian@debian
```

## Modding the design: adding a peripheral device

### Use Vivado Block Design to add an IP

Open Vivado:
```
source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.2/settings64.sh
make CONFIG=rocket64b2 BOARD=nexys-video vivado-gui
```
The IO block in the design is the best place to add device controllers, like GPIO.
See AXI Uartlite as an example, connect your IP to AXI interconnect and interrupts.
Validate and synthesize the design, but don't build bitstream yet - device tree and RISC-V HDL need to be updated first.

Close Vivado.

### Check the device driver is enabled in patches/linux.config

For example, for Xilinx GPIO, the config should contain line:
```
CONFIG_GPIO_XILINX=y
```

If necessary, change config, then rebuild Linux kernel and bootloader:
```
make linux bootloader
./mk-sd-image -r debian-riscv64-boot
```
Copy debian-riscv64-boot/extlinux directory to the SD card.

Note: don't change files in the project submodules: linux-stable, u-boot, opensbi or rocket-chip.
Such changes are lost when the project is rebuilt.

For details on Xilinx drivers, see [Linux Drivers](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841873/Linux%2BDrivers).

### Edit board/nexys-video/bootrom.dts

Add device description in the "io-bus {...}" section.
For example, GPIO description can look like this:
```
        gpio: gpio@60030000 {
            #gpio-cells = <2>;
            compatible = "xlnx,xps-gpio-1.00.a";
            gpio-controller ;
            interrupt-parent = <&L2>;
            interrupts = <4>;
            reg = < 0x60030000 0x10000 >;
            xlnx,all-inputs = <0x0>;
            xlnx,dout-default = <0x0>;
            xlnx,gpio-width = <0x8>;
            xlnx,interrupt-present = <0x1>;
            xlnx,is-dual = <0>;
            xlnx,tri-default = <0xffffffff>;
        };
```
Make sure the description matches your design. In particular, check addresses and interrupt numbers.

### Rebuild FPGA bitstream
```
make CONFIG=rocket64b2 BOARD=nexys-video bitstream
```
Program the FPGA or the board flash memory.

# Prebuilt images

Prebuilt FPGA bitstream and SD card image are available in the [releases area](https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v/releases).

# Notes

Rocket Chip is used as RISC-V implementation: [UC Berkeley Architecture Research - Rocket Chip Generator](https://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/rocket_chip.html).
Rocket Chip is configured to include virtual memory, instruction and data caches, coherent interconnect, floating point, and all the relevant infrastructure.
See [rocket.scala](https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v/blob/master/src/main/scala/rocket.scala) for Rocket Chip configuration classes.

RISC-V SoC in this repo contains bootrom, which differ from original Rocket Chip bootrom.
The modified bootrom contains SD card boot loader and extended device tree.

RISC-V SoC in this repo contains DDR, UART, SD and Ethernet controllers.
DDR is provided by Vivado. UART, SD and Ethernet are open source Verilog.

SD controller implements SD HS (High Speed) specs, 25MB/s read/write speed.

Ethernet controller is based on [Verilog Ethernet Components](https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-ethernet) project,
which is a collection of Ethernet-related components for gigabit, 10G, and 25G packet processing.

Linux kernel and U-Boot use device tree, which is stored in RISC-V bootrom in FPGA.
So, same SD card should boot OK on any board or RISC-V configuration.

Nexys Video and Nexys A7 boards can be configured to [load FPGA bitstream from SD card](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-video/reference-manual#usb_host_and_micro_sd_programming).

The device tree contains Ethernet MAC address, which is not unique.
It might be necessary to rebuild bitstream with different MAC, see Makefile for details.

If not using provided SD card image: the bootrom loads and executes boot.elf file from SD card DOS partition.
boot.elf is regular executable ELF, it can contain any software suitable for RISC-V RV64 M mode.
In case of Linux boot, boot.elf contains OpenSBI and U-Boot.

The Makefile creates Vivado project directory, e.g. workspace/rocket64b2/vivado-nexys-video-riscv.
You can open the project in Vivado GUI to see RISC-V SoC structure, make changes, add peripherals, rebuild the bitstream.
The SoC occupies portion of FPGA, leaving plenty of space for experiments and developing additional hardware.

RISC-V SoC in this repo uses BSCAN block to support both RISC-V debugging and FPGA access over same JTAG cable.
